## The world‚Äôs first flashing app that makes flashing as easy as moving a file.
No terminals. No setup. Just drop ‚Äî and done.

Flashing STM32 firmware has never been this simple.  
**AMN STM32 Flasher** replaces command lines and scripts with a single action:  
**drag and drop** your `.bin` file ‚Äî the app detects your ST-LINK, erases memory,  
installs, verifies, and protects your firmware automatically.

Built for developers, engineers, and makers who value **speed**, **clarity**, and **style**.  
Everything just works  beautifully.

## üß≠ Vision

> ### *‚ÄúFlashing firmware should be as simple as moving a file.‚Äù*

AMN STM32 Flasher redefines how developers interact with embedded hardware.  
It‚Äôs fast, intuitive, and designed with the same care as the devices it programs.  
For the first time, flashing feels human.


---

## üß† What Makes It Different

Where others demand commands, AMN Flasher listens to intent.  
It detects your tools, flashes your board, and visualizes the process ‚Äî automatically.  

Everything you touch in the app is alive:  
Every button adapts, every widget responds, every action has a shortcut.  

> It doesn‚Äôt just work ‚Äî it understands what you want to do.

## üß∞ Installation

### üîπ Requirements
- ü™ü **Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)**
- üîó [**ST-LINK Utility**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html)  
  *(Includes `ST-LINK_CLI` and ST-LINK drivers ‚Äî provided by STMicroelectronics.)*  
  We recommend installing the **official ST-LINK Utility** for best performance.  
  If you‚Äôve already installed STM32 board support in the **Arduino IDE**, that‚Äôs also sufficient.

### üîπ Steps
1. Download the latest version from the [üì¶ Releases](https://github.com/aneeshmurali-n/AMN-STM32-Flasher/releases) page.  
2. Run **`AMN STM32 Flasher Setup.exe`** and complete the installation.  
3. Launch **AMN STM32 Flasher**.  


---


## üß† How to Use

1. **Connect** your STM32 board via ST-LINK.  
2. **Open** AMN STM32 Flasher.  
3. **Drop or select** your `.bin` firmware file.  
4. **Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù** ‚Äî or do nothing if Instant Flash Mode is enabled.  
5. **Done.** Your firmware is installed, verified, and optionally protected.  

> ‚ú® Everything happens automatically ‚Äî simply connect, drop, and flash.
> 
> ‚ö° No terminal. No manual setup. Just a **file drop**

| Shortcut       | Action                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Q`            | ‚ö° Toggle Drop Flash Mode (Enable / Disable)|
| `D` / `Delete` | üßΩ Clear firmware from workspace.           |
| `I` / `Enter`  | ‚¨áÔ∏è Install firmware                         |
| `A` / `Enter`  | ‚ûï Add firmware file                        |
| `P` / `E`      | üîí Enable / Disable Read Protection (RDP1)|

> Every action is one keystroke away.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration file is automatically created at:  
`Documents/AMNSTM32Flasher/settings.json`

You can edit this file to adjust flashing behavior and preferences.

### üß© Example:
```json
{
    "FLASH_START_ADDR": "0x08000000",
    "DROP_FLASH": "ENABLED"
}
```
üí° Parameters

`FLASH_START_ADDR` ‚Äî Start address for firmware flashing (default 0x08000000, standard for most STM32 MCUs).
Only change this if you are flashing to a custom memory region.

`DROP_FLASH` ‚Äî Controls Instant Flash Mode (`ENABLED` / `DISABLED`)

> The app manages this file automatically ‚Äî manual edits are rarely needed.


---


### ‚úÖ Compatibility

Supports all STM32 microcontrollers compatible with ST-LINK CLI over SWD.  
Default flash region: `0x08000000`.  
Advanced users can adjust this address in the configuration file.
