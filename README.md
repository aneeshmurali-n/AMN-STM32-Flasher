**AMN STM32 Flasher** is a one-click **firmware flasher** and **installable firmware package creator** for STM32 microcontrollers.  
It makes flashing STM32 devices **as easy as installing a regular application**.

You can use it in two ways:

### üß© Option 1 ‚Äì As a Firmware Package Creator
Simply click **Add Firmware**, then press **C** to create an installable firmware package.  
Share the generated package ‚Äî and your users can:

1. **Extract** the firmware package.  
2. **Connect** their STM32 MCU to a PC via an **ST-Link programmer**.  
3. **Run** the `AMN STM32 Flasher.exe` file inside the extracted folder.  
4. *(Optional)* Enable **Firmware Protection (RDP1)** if desired, then click **Install**.  

The firmware will be automatically written to the chip ‚Äî  
no source code, no IDE, and no complex setup required.  

### ‚ö° Option 2 ‚Äì As a Flashing Tool
You can also use **AMN STM32 Flasher** directly as a standard flasher.  
Just install it like a regular application, then:

1. **Run the app** from the desktop shortcut.  
2. Press **A** or **Enter** (or click **Add Firmware**) to select your `.bin` firmware.  
3. *(Optional)* Enable **Firmware Protection** if you want to activate read protection.  
4. Press **Enter** or click **Install** to flash your STM32 device instantly.  

This tool is perfect for **beginners and non-experienced users**, allowing anyone to try STM32 projects **without compiling code or setting up development environments**.  
It also **saves time for experienced embedded engineers** through fully automated flashing and package creation.

## How It Works

<img width="755" height="389" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 233050" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/383ebed1-d129-4bfb-8916-8acf0879dec0" />

1. Click Add Firmware or press `A` / `Enter` on key board to add the `.bin` firmware in the `bin` folder.

<img width="1220" height="506" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 233123" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a410f1e-960d-4f8a-9d92-1f7904f7b2b7" />

2. Browse your firmware file.

3. Connect your STM32 MCU to your PC via **ST-Link V2**.



4. (Optional) Check **Enable Firmware Protection** if you want to enable read protection (RDP1).

You can also share this app along with your `.bin` file in the `bin` folder. It works like a **package installer**, allowing someone else to flash the MCU with **just one click**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è External Tools

This application does **not include or bundle** any STMicroelectronics software.  
It simply sends standard command-line instructions to **ST-LINK_CLI.exe** if it is already installed on your system.

`ST-LINK_CLI.exe` is a proprietary tool developed by **STMicroelectronics** for communicating with STM32 devices.  
You must install it separately using one of the following:
- **ST-LINK Utility**  
- **STM32CubeProgrammer**  
- **Arduino STM32 Core** (STM32F1xx / GD32F1xx boards)

Usage of `ST-LINK_CLI.exe` is subject to **STMicroelectronics‚Äô license terms**, independent of this software.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- The app **does not redistribute** or embed `ST-LINK_CLI.exe`.  
- It **interacts externally** with it (similar to running commands in Command Prompt).  
- Users must ensure compliance with **STMicroelectronics‚Äô licensing terms**. 

---

## Configuration (`bin/settings.json`)

Example:

```json
{
  "FLASH_START_ADDR": "0x08000000"
}
```
- FLASH_START_ADDR ‚Äì Flash start address (usually 0x08000000 for STM32). Adjust as needed.
