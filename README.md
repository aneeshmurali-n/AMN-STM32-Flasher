## 🏆 The World’s First Drag-and-Drop Firmware Flasher

**No terminals. No setup. No stress.**  
Just **drop your firmware** — and watch your STM32 flash itself.

Flashing STM32 firmware has never been this simple.  
**AMN STM32 Flasher** replaces command lines and scripts with a single action:  
**drag and drop** your `.bin` file — the app detects your ST-LINK, erases memory,  
installs, verifies, and protects your firmware automatically.

Built for developers, engineers, and makers who value **speed**, **clarity**, and **style**.  
Everything just works  beautifully.

## 🧠 Why It’s Different

**AMN STM32 Flasher** was built for humans.

It’s the first tool that turns flashing into a **single natural action** — just drop your `.bin` file.  
No setup, no scripts, no console output — everything happens automatically.  

It detects your ST-LINK, erases, flashes, verifies, and protects your firmware —  
with live progress, instant feedback, and a clean, modern interface.  

> ⚡ **Where others demand commands, AMN STM32 Flasher just works.**

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Launch** the app  
2. **Drop or Select** your `.bin` firmware  
3. **Click “Install”** or Do nothing — if Drop Flash is enabled, it starts instantly.  
4. **Done.**  
   Your firmware is installed, verified, and optionally protected.

## 🧰 Installation

### 🔹 Requirements
- 🪟 **Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)**
- 🐍 **Python 3.14+** *(only required for development or source builds)*
- 🔗 [**ST-LINK CLI**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html)  
  *(Included in the official ST-LINK Utility package from STMicroelectronics)*

### 🔹 Steps
1. Download the latest version from the [📦 Releases](https://github.com/aneeshmurali-n/AMN-STM32-Flasher/releases) page.  
2. Run **`AMN STM32 Flasher Setup.exe`** and complete the installation.  
3. Launch the app.  
4. Drag and drop your `.bin` firmware file — flashing begins automatically!  

> ⚡ No terminal. No manual setup. Just **drop and flash.**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **AMN STM32 Flasher** does not include or distribute `ST-LINK_CLI.exe` or any STMicroelectronics software.  
- The application only **communicates externally** with `ST-LINK_CLI.exe`, executing standard command-line operations securely and transparently.  
- Users must install the official **ST-LINK Utility** separately and ensure compliance with **STMicroelectronics’ licensing terms**.  
- For best results, keep the ST-LINK Utility installed in its default directory
- 💡 **No worries:** AMN STM32 Flasher automatically detects the correct ST-LINK path — no manual setup required.

## ⚙️ Configuration File (`settings.json`)

The configuration file is automatically created in:  
`Documents/AMNSTM32Flasher/settings.json`

You can edit this file to adjust flashing behavior and preferences.

### 🧩 Example:
```json
{
    "FLASH_START_ADDR": "0x08000000",
    "DROP_FLASH": "ENABLED"
}
```
💡 Parameters

FLASH_START_ADDR — Defines the starting memory address for firmware flashing.
Default: 0x08000000 (standard for most STM32 MCUs).
Only change this if you are flashing to a custom memory region.

DROP_FLASH — Stores the current state of the Drop Flash feature.

"ENABLED" → Automatically flashes when a .bin file is dropped into the window.

"DISABLED" → File drop still replaces the previous firmware, but flashing occurs only when you press Install or use shortcuts.

⚙️ The app manages this file automatically — manual edits are optional and rarely needed.
