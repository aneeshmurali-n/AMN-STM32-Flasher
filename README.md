**AMN STM32 Flasher** is a one-click firmware flasher for STM32 microcontrollers.  
It makes flashing STM32 devices **as easy as installing a regular application**. Simply place the compiled `.bin` firmware in the `bin` folder, share the app, and your users can:

1. Connect their MCU to a PC.  
2. Run the app.  
3. Click **Install**.  

The firmware is automatically burned onto the chip ‚Äî no source code, no code editor, and no complex setup required.  

This tool is perfect for **beginners and non-experienced users**, allowing anyone to try out STM32 projects **without compiling code or setting up development environments**. It also **saves time for experienced embedded system engineers**, as everything is fully automated.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Easy Firmware Flashing** ‚Äì Install firmware as easily as a standard application.  
- **One-Click Flash** ‚Äì Flash your device with a single click.  
- **Create Firmware Installer** ‚Äì Package your firmware as a single-click installer.  
- **Automatic Firmware Detection** ‚Äì Detects `.bin` firmware files in the `bin` folder automatically.  
- **ST-LINK_CLI Automatic Detection** ‚Äì Detects and uses `ST-LINK_CLI.exe` installed on your system.  
- **Modern Dark UI** ‚Äì Sleek dark mode interface with a purple-green theme.  
- **Optional Firmware Protection** ‚Äì Enable/disable read protection (RDP1).  
- **Smooth Progress Feedback** ‚Äì Real-time progress bar and status updates.  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** ‚Äì Quickly access key functions without using the mouse.  

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut       | Action                                   |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `D` / `Delete` | üóëÔ∏è Delete added firmware file            |
| `C`            | üì¶ Create firmware installer             |
| `I` / `Enter`  | ‚ö° Flash firmware                        |
| `A`            | ‚ûï Add firmware file                     |
| `P` / `E`      | üîí Enable / Disable Read Protection (RDP1) |

## How It Works

1. Place the `.bin` firmware in the `bin` folder.  
2. Connect your STM32 MCU to your PC via **ST-Link V2**.
3. Run the app.
4. (Optional) Check **Enable Firmware Protection** to enable read protection (RDP1).  
5. Click **Install**.  

The firmware will be flashed automatically with **real-time progress updates**.  
You can also share this app along with your `.bin` file in the `bin` folder. It works like a **package installer**, allowing someone else to flash the MCU with **just one click**.

## Dependencies & Licensing

- `ST-LINK_CLI.exe` from **STMicroelectronics** is required to flash STM32 devices.  
  - The app **does not include or redistribute** this executable, it must be installed on your system.  
  - See **Important Notice** below for licensing information.

---

## Important Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **ST-LINK_CLI.exe is not included** due to ST‚Äôs licensing restrictions.  

- You **do not need to copy or redistribute** it. The app will detect it automatically if installed.  
- Copying `ST-LINK_CLI.exe` into the app folder **may violate ST‚Äôs license**. This is **your responsibility**, not the developer‚Äôs.  
- Ensure that one of the supported ST programs is installed:  
  - ST-LINK Utility  
  - Arduino STM32 cores (STM32F1xx/GD32F1xx boards by stm32duino)  

The app is designed to work without copying files, so **please comply with ST‚Äôs license**.

---

## Configuration (`bin/settings.json`)

Example:

```json
{
  "FLASH_START_ADDR": "0x08000000"
}
```
- FLASH_START_ADDR ‚Äì Flash start address (usually 0x08000000 for STM32). Adjust as needed.

---


## Requirements

### Running the Executable

- Windows 10 or 11  
- Installed ST-LINK_CLI.exe (via ST-LINK Utility or STM32 Arduino cores)

### Running from Source

- Python 3.12.5 or higher  
- Required Python packages:  
  - `customtkinter==5.2.2`

## Why Use This App?

- Turn your firmware into a **sharable installer** for easy distribution.  
- Perfect for beginners who don‚Äôt want to deal with code editors or compilation.  
- Saves time for experienced embedded engineers with fully automated flashing.  
- Makes STM32 projects **accessible and easy to try** for anyone following tutorials or using shared firmware packages.
